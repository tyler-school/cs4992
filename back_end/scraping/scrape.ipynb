      "The US and US-led United Nations Command say they are working to resolve the situation involving a US soldier who ran into North Korea at a border village. The incident involving Private 2nd class Travis King comes at a time of high tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n",
      "The pace of both North Korea's weapons demonstrations and US-South Korean military exercises has intensified lately in a cycle of tit-for-tat.\n",
      "Other Americans have crossed into North Korea over the years, including a few US soldiers. Some of the Americans were motivated by evangelical zeal or simply attracted by the mystery of a severely cloistered police state fueled by anti-US hatred. \n",
      "Other Americans were detained after entering North Korea as tourists. In one tragic case, it ended in death.\n",
      "Here’s a look at other Americans who entered North Korea in the past years:\n",
      "Charles Jenkins \n",
      "Born in Rich Square, NC, Charles Jenkins was one of the few Cold War-era U.S. soldiers who fled to North Korea while serving in the South.\n",
      "Jenkins, then an Army sergeant, deserted his post in 1965 and fled across the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas. North Korea treated Jenkins as a propaganda asset, showcasing him in leaflets and films.\n",
      "In 1980, Jenkins married 21-year-old Hitomi Soga, a Japanese nursing student who had been abducted by North Korean agents in 1978.\n",
      "Soga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002. In 2004, Jenkins was allowed to leave North Korea and rejoin his wife in Japan, where he surrendered to U.S. military authorities and faced charges that he abandoned his unit and defected to North Korea. He was dishonorably discharged and sentenced to 25 days in a U.S. military jail in Japan. He died in Japan in 2017.\n",
      "Bruce Byron Lowrance \n",
      "It’s clear that North Korea’s handling of American detainees is influenced by the state of its relations with Washington.\n",
      "Bruce Byron Lowrance benefited from cozy diplomacy in 2018 between then-U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who met for a summit in June that year where they issued aspirational goals for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.\n",
      "Five months later, North Korea announced it was expelling Lowrance who had entered the country illegally through China in October. North Korea’s decision to deport Lowrance after only a month of confinement was remarkably quick by the country’s standards, apparently reflecting an eagerness to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue with the United States.\n",
      "During the buildup to the Trump-Kim summit in June, North Korea released three American detainees – Kim Dong Chul, Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song — who returned to home on a plane with then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n",
      "However, the diplomacy broke down after the second Trump-Kim summit in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.\n",
      "Matthew Miller\n",
      "In September 2014, then a 24-year-old from Bakersfield, California, Matthew Miller was sentenced to six years of hard labor by North Korea’s Supreme Court on charges that he illegally entered the country for spying purposes.\n",
      "The court claimed that Miller tore up his tourist visa upon arriving at Pyongyang’s airport in April that year and admitted to a “wild ambition” of experiencing North Korean prison life so that he could secretly investigate the country’s human rights conditions.\n",
      "North Korea’s initial announcement about Miller’s detainment that month came as then-President Barack Obama was traveling in South Korea on a state visit.\n",
      "Miller was freed in November that same year along with another American, Kenneth Bae, a missionary and tour leader.\n",
      "Weeks before his release, Miller talked with The Associated Press at a Pyongyang hotel where North Korean officials allowed him to call his family. Miller said he was digging in fields eight hours a day and being kept in isolation.\n",
      " Kenneth Bae \n",
      "Bae, a Korean-American missionary from Lynnwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 while leading a tour group in a special North Korean economic zone.\n",
      "North Korea sentenced Bae to 15 years in prison for “hostile acts,” including smuggling in inflammatory literature and attempting to establish a base for anti-government activities at a hotel in a border town. Bae’s family said he suffered from chronic health issues, including back pain, diabetes, and heart and liver problems.\n",
      "Bae returned to the United States in November 2014 following a secret mission by James Clapper, then-U.S. director of national intelligence who also secured Miller’s release.\n",
      "Jeffrey Fowle \n",
      "A month before Bae's and Miller’s release, North Korea also freed Jeffrey Fowle, an Ohio municipal worker who was detained for six months for leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the city of Chongjin. Fowle’s release followed negotiations that involved retired diplomat and former Ohio Congressman Tony Hall.\n",
      "While North Korea officially guarantees freedom of religion, analysts and defectors describe the country as strictly anti-religious. The distribution of Bibles and secret prayer services can mean imprisonment or execution, defectors say.\n",
      "In 2009, American missionary Robert Park walked into North Korea with a Bible in his hand to draw attention to North Korea’s human rights abuses. Park, who was deported from the North in February 2010, has said he was tortured by authorities.\n",
      "Otto Warmbier \n",
      "Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, died in June 2017, shortly after he was flown home in a coma after 17 months in North Korean captivity.\n",
      "Warmbier was seized by North Korean authorities from a tour group in January 2016 and convicted on charges of trying to steal a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.\n",
      "While not providing a clear reason for Warmbier’s brain damage, North Korea denied accusations by Warmbier’s family that he was tortured and insisted that it had provided him medical care with “all sincerity.” The North accused the United States of a smear campaign and claimed itself as the “biggest victim” in his death.\n",
      "In 2022, a U.S. federal judge in New York ruled that Warmbier’s parents — Fred and Cindy Warmbier — should receive $240,300 seized from a North Korean bank account, which would be a partial payment toward the more than $501 million they were awarded in 2018 by a federal judge in Washington.\n",

      "Children waiting over a year in pain for NHS tooth removal - BBC News\n",
      "Children in some areas of England are waiting up to 18 months on average for dental general-anaesthetic treatment and teeth extractions, an investigation reveals.\n",
      "Some have been left with prolonged dental pain, according to information shared with BBC News.\n",
      "The parents of one girl who has waited three years for extractions say the pain keeps her up at night.  \n",
      "Removing decayed teeth is the most common reason for needing the service.\n",
      "At the start of this year, more than 12,000 under-18s were on waiting lists for assessment or treatment at community dental service (CDS) providers, data obtained by the Liberal Democrats from the NHS Business Services Authority and shared with BBC News earlier this year reveals.\n",
      "Children are referred to a CDS provider when they have tooth decay too severe to be treated in general practice.\n",
      "They also treat those with physical or learning disabilities when general practice is not a practical option.\n",
      "The longest average wait faced by children for general-anaesthetic treatment at a CDS provider is 80 weeks, at Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust.\n",
      "But some providers have much lower average waits - at Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, it is just three weeks.\n",
      "Ella Mann, eight, from Dovercourt, Essex, has been waiting three years to have rotten teeth removed.\n",
      "She first went to the dentist with a painful milk tooth in December 2019, was given a temporary filling and told it needed to be removed but has still not had the NHS procedure - and now, seven more of her milk teeth need to be removed.\n",
      "Ella's father, Charlie, says the pain \"keeps her up at night\".\n",
      "He says: \"It always seems to be in the evening that she suffers the pain. So then obviously we've got the problem of overnight and then fatigue because obviously she's awake most of the night.\n",
      "\"She's started to sort of resent brushing her teeth because it's giving her pain - and we're starting to get concerned it's going to cause further problems.\n",
      "\"You're waiting and waiting and waiting for something to be done about it. They are doing temporary fillings. They're doing temporary jobs on it.\n",
      "\"It's just not right that children should be waiting.\"\n",
      "Tooth decay is the most common reason six- to 10-year-olds are admitted to hospital.\n",
      "In England, more than 42,000 teeth were extracted from under-19s in 2021-22, costing the NHS an estimated £81m.\n",
      "Office for Health Improvement and Disparities analysis reveals a gap between regions in England.\n",
      "In the 2021-22 financial year:\n",
      "Your device may not support this visualisation\n",
      "Staff at Maybury Primary School, in Hull, are doing their best to help keep pupils' teeth healthy.\n",
      "Every pupil brushes their teeth after lunch.\n",
      "Head teacher Alison Grantham says toothache \"has a massive impact on learning because they're missing lessons\".\n",
      "\"And if you're coming to school and you're trying to concentrate and trying to learn while you're in pain, then that's going to have impact, too,\" she says.\n",
      "\"Trying to get dental support in this area, it is really hard for parents to sign children up for a dentist. This area that the children come from, there is a high level of tooth decay.\n",
      "\"We don't like to see any of our children suffering or in pain - but a lot of the time, there's something you can do straightaway that can help that. \"But with teeth, it's far more difficult. There's no magic solution.\"\n",
      "Disappearing Dentists\n",
      "Some people are going to extraordinary measure to do DIY dentistry as they struggle to find affordable dental care. Are we witnessing the death of NHS dentistry? \n",
      "Watch now on BBC iPlayer\n",
      "Dentists from the charity Teeth Team visit children at primary schools across Hull and parts of East Yorkshire. And BBC News joined them at Maybury Primary in May.Among the 169 children given a dental check-up that day, there were 263 decayed teeth.\n",
      "Some of these children will need extractions under general anaesthetic in hospital.\n",
      "Sara Feldt, from Teeth Team, says the needs in the school are \"exceptionally high\".\n",
      "\"A high proportion of those are in urgent need, which is four or more decays or cavities in the children's teeth,\" she says.\n",
      "\"We've had two today that have told us that they are in pain. One told us that they've got an abscess, so we're going to deal with that.\n",
      "\"It's disturbing. It's not very nice to see, because a child's going under a general anaesthetic for something that's preventable. It doesn't have to happen.\n",
      "\"Good oral hygiene, regular toothbrushing, limiting sugar, limiting the fizzy drinks. We need a little bit more education out there to prevent this happening.\n",
      "\"I like the fact that we're coming into the schools, because sometimes that's the only kind of time the children will see a dentist.\n",
      "\"We all know that the access to a dentist at the moment is really difficult. So to be able to do that, I think it's really positive.\n",
      "\"It needs to be rolled out nationwide, not just Hull.\"\n",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care official said: \"We are working to improve access to NHS dental care - investing more than £3bn a year into dentistry - and the number of children seen by NHS dentists rose by 43.6% last year.\n",
      "\"We have increased the funding practices receive for urgent care, to encourage dentists to provide more NHS treatments and we're also taking preventative measures to improve children's oral health, such as expanding water-fluoridation schemes - which can significantly reduce the number of children experiencing tooth decay. Further reforms are planned for this year.\"\n",
